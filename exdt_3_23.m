% Create a vector for one period of the signal x[n]
x = [0,0.5,1,0.75,0,-0.75,-1,-0.5];
% Compute the average signal power using one period of the signal
Px = x*x'/8   % Use scalar product of a vector with its transpose
% Create a vector of harmonic indices
k = [0:7];
% Compute DTFS coefficients
ck = ss_dtfs(x,k)
% Compute the average signal power using DTFS coefficients.
Px = ck*ck'   % Use scalar product of a vector with its transpose
